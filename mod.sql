--Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.
select distinct city from STATION where id%2=0 
----->MOD(id,2)=0 is the standard formula for doing modulous it means we are doing modulous of ID by 2 and the reminder should be 0, like if we want to get odd so we can write like MOD(ID,2)=1 like that, but you can try ID%2=0
