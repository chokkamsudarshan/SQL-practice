--Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
select round(min(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n>38.7780;
-- Another way to do it
-- select truncate(min(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n>38.7780;
-- Explanation:
-- In this query, we find the minimum value of the LAT_N column from the STATION table that is greater than 38.7780 using the MIN function. The ROUND function is then applied to round the result to 4 decimal places.
-- Note:
-- The MIN() function is used to find the smallest value of LAT_N within the specified condition.
-- The ROUND() function is used to round the result to 4 decimal places.
-- The WHERE clause is used to filter LAT_N values based on the given condition.
-- The TRUNCATE() function can be used as an alternative to ROUND() to truncate the
